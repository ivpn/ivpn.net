      Good that you don't support this very unethical behavior. I made a good decision by choosing you as my VPN provider.

      I am using different VPN affiliate programs on my blog and its working good. PureVPN is doing good in conversion.
    
      VPN is untap industry for affiliates. You should not close it.

      A strange decision. Although we do not clean up your service from allvpn.org rating, because it is based on users opinions rather than remuneration.

      Thank you both to iVPN and That One Privacy Guy for your efforts on this. In fairness to the affiliates who did not comply, it cannot be assumed that they are unscrupulous. But without complying, there is no way iVPN.net can determine that. It is hard to justify the overhead to run the affiliate program in these circumstances, and it's a shame that the handful of affiliates who were willing to comply find themselves disadvantaged by those who would not.

      Keep up the good work. iVPN does a good job of educating their clients and the public about what a VPN can and cannot do, especially with respect to the topics of privacy, jurisdiction and data retention. The comparison websites are helpful, but better to understand in as much depth as you can what a VPN provider can and cannot do.

      Counter productive move.
    
      Now all those affiliate bloggers will start advertising other crappy VPNs out there.
        
      No benefit to the end user who reads those reviews instead of digging up on their own a little bit.
        
      So congratulations, you didn't fix anything, you just made a bigger problem imho.

      "VPN is untap industry for affiliates" - Hey genius, some things are worth more than squeezing a financial derivative out of someone else's hard work! Privacy and integrity are two things rapidly disappearing in this world, yet loved when still encountered. Business doesn't have to be about hating your fellow man (including by mildly or heavily deceiving him about which product to buy). Engineering excellence, intelligent management and leadership are to be cherished. If we can help maintain a culture that involves these qualities, then perhaps we can expand it to politics and the wider world, who knows? It's certainly overdue. But the more we keep thinking we're clever to make money - to play someone else's game the rules of which were never voted upon democratically (World Banking System, anyone?) the more we are destined to suffer the same upon us - and NO ONE can watch their back 24/7. You end up dying of exhaustion, believe me! From having lived under oppression, I know what ethics are worth. IF this company actually has some, it is vastly more important that they are upheld than some middlemen oxygen-thieves make themselves some easy money. Go find a job, fool. A REAL one.

      Wow, finally I see someone else say something about this. I can tell you how frustrated I was a few months ago when I was looking for a new provider. Its so frustrating going around in circles trying to find REAL reviews. Its so discouraging. It's counterproductive and unsustainable behavior though. there really should be a legit vpn review

      Good work. It took me a long time to find IVPN because of all the liars out there. They made ProtonVPN look good, but not even one day into their free trial, their server quit and leaked all over my desktop, and I couldn't even hit their website from the open Net. Reading this blog post has increased my trust level one full point in favor of IVPN. Trust is the most important factor in choosing a VPN.

      This response is linguistically crafted with excellence. Well written, and in a way that strikes or "pokes" the person mentally, to get your valid points across and heard.

      Thanks for another great post. Where else may anybody get that kind of information in such an ideal means of writing? I've a presentation subsequent week, and I'm on the search for such info. <a href="https://anunturi-parbrize.ro/parbriz-bmw-7.html" rel="nofollow ugc">https://anunturi-parbrize.ro/parbriz-bmw-7.html</a>

A few weeks ago, we communicated to affiliates that our affiliate program would be closing. For those interested, this post provides some background on how we reached that decision.

When IVPN launched, we never intended to create an affiliate program. We simply provided a link in our control panel, for customers to refer friends and receive credit. When we realised professional affiliates were signing up as customers to get a link, we created a separate signup page for them. As the VPN industry grew, a dizzying number of 'Best/top VPN' comparison sites popped up. And with the increasing competition, along came increasingly unethical behavior (which is certainly not unique to the VPN industry).

One example is the voucher code scam, where affiliates advertise coupons/vouchers that don't exist (we don't offer any coupons/vouchers) to rank their website on Google for keywords such as 'ivpn coupon'. They do this to take advantage of the fact that many Internet shoppers are conditioned, when arriving on a checkout page, to open a new browser tab to search for discount codes. They would then find the affiliates page, click through on the link, and arrive back on the IVPN site. Even though they don't receive any discount, the affiliate still gets paid, even though they didn't actually refer the customer to us. We would have made the sale anyway, and so the affiliate is effectively stealing 25% of our revenue. 

One of the most offensive practices is the offer to pay for top rankings. In some cases, these artificial rankings are disclosed within 'sponsored' areas. But in many cases, they are not. In addition, it's clear to us that many unscrupulous affiliates rank providers in order of potential revenue. Providers that have better commission offerings, or website conversion rates, go straight to the top. It's not hard to see why. Many affiliates are spending thousands, or even tens of thousands, of dollars on advertising to get visitors to their site, and they lose if a visitor clicks through to a VPN and doesn't buy.

Why does this matter? When someone goes to Google and asks for the 'Best VPN' they expect to find information aiding them in identifying the best VPN for their needs. Not only would the above practices compromise this, but in some cases, people are using VPNs in circumstances where compromising their anonymity could be life threatening. For this reason alone, its imperative that companies advertising VPN services are honest about their relationship with the brands they are advocating. In the USA this principle is encoded in [FTC guidelines][1]. 

In May of this year, we were contacted by [That one privacy site][2] stating that they had found that several of our affiliates had not implemented a clear and conspicuous disclaimer, even though it was required in our terms of service. We proceeded to audit our affiliates, and discovered that less than 5% were in compliance. It was a major failing on our part to have not caught this earlier. 

We sent out an email asking all affiliates to implement the disclosure within 6 weeks. The response was depressing, with only a handful willing to comply, and many on the offensive. Indeed, too few compliant affiliates remained to justify the overhead of running an affiliate program. We would rather focus on building a better VPN service. 

We would like to thank all honest and hard working affiliates who worked with us over the last five years, and helped to grow IVPN into the service it is today.
