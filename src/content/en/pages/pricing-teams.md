# IVPN for teams

IVPN is well suited for distributed team members to improve their privacy from unwanted data collection and data security on untrusted networks. We offer volume discounts, administrative tools and 2FA on demand. We cannot provide dedicated servers/IPs or facilitate access to corporate networks.
