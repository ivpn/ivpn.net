# What VPN protocols do you offer?

IVPN supports OpenVPN (2.3.7 and up), WireGuardÂ®, and IPSec with IKEv2.

The IVPN App for all platforms supports OpenVPN and WireGuard connections.  The IVPN App for iOS also supports IPSec with IKEv2 connections.  Check the app's `Settings > Connection` (desktop) or `Settings > Protocol` (mobile) area for protocol details and options.

The VPN server [status page](https://www.ivpn.net/status) indicates which servers support which protocols.  Servers with the `openvpn` tag also accept IPSec with IKEv2 connections.

We do not support PPTP or L2TP/IPSec.

View our [setup guides](/apps/) at the bottom of the IVPN App's download page for more information about manual VPN connections.
