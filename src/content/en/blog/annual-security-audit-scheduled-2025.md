Consistent with our commitment to [regular independent security audits](https://www.ivpn.net/en/blog/tags/audit/), we have scheduled our seventh annual security audit with [Cure53](https://cure53.de/), to be conducted over the course of two weeks in May.

As in previous years, audits will target systems and services undergoing significant updates. As part of a broader rollout planned later this year we are launching two new privacy-focused services (optional and free additions for all IVPN Pro accounts). Scope of audits:

**IVPN Email Forwarding Service**
- Pen-test and source code audit covering App UI and API

**IVPN DNS Service**
- Pen-test and source code audit covering App UI and API

Looking ahead, our ongoing IVPN infrastructure upgrade - including transitioning to RAM-only servers - remains a priority with test deployments under way. Audits next year will focus specifically on evaluating new infrastructure rolled out throughout the rest of 2025.
