**In summary: We identified a potential DNS leak issue affecting our iOS app in brief intervals during WireGuard key regeneration.**

## Details of the issue

When IVPN iOS app rotates WireGuard keys while VPN is connected, the app calls the asynchronous method `setTunnelNetworkSettings` to update VPN tunnel with new configuration. At both the start and completion of `setTunnelNetworkSettings` , the IVPN app does not register the VPN tunnel as disconnected. A DNS leak test identifies a brief window where the VPN tunnel temporarily disconnects., causing network traffic to bypass the tunnel.

To fix this issue,  an additional `reasserting: Bool` flag is now implemented when calling the `setTunnelNetworkSettings` method. This signals to the OS/device that VPN tunnel is being updated - setting this flag prevents any network traffic from bypassing the VPN tunnel.
