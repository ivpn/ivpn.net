# Do you support Tunnelblick / Viscosity?

Yes. Both Tunnelbrick and Viscosity are software packages designed for macOS which allow you to connect to VPN services like IVPN.

See our [Tunnelblick setup guide](/setup/macos-openvpn-tunnelblick/) for more details.

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--info">
We highly recommend using the IVPN client over a 3rd party client such as Tunnelblick as we have implemented many advanced security features.
