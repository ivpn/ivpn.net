# Antivirus detects malware in the IVPN installer, why?

False positive detections are common in the antivirus industry. They occur when a benign program is wrongfully flagged as malicious due to an overly broad detection signature or algorithm used in an antivirus product.

As long as the installation file was downloaded from our [website](/apps/) you can rest assured it's 100% secure and should be added to your antivirus' exceptions list.
