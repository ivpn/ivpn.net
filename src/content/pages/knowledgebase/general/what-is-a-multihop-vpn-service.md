# What is a Multi-hop VPN service?

When connecting to a multi-hop server, instead of your traffic being routed through a single VPN server, it is routed through two VPN servers. This technology has been carefully incorporated into the IVPN network using the same 256-bit OpenVPN and WireGuard encryption as the single-hop VPN servers. Multi-hop connections offer significantly higher levels of anonymity and privacy, however, they are slightly slower than single-hop connections due to the additional hop that your traffic is routed through. We offer our customers a choice of single and multi-hop connections for both WireGuard and OpenVPN.

The Multi-hop feature is available in our Pro plan.
