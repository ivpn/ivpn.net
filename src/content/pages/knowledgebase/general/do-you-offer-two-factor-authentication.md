# Do you offer Two-Factor Authentication?

Yes, and it can be easily enabled in just a few steps:

1. Login to your [Client Area](/account/login/#id)

2. Navigate to `Account settings` and check the `2-factor authentication` checkbox.

3. Scan the barcode using the preferred TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) app, e.g. **Google Authenticator**.

4. Enter the generated 6-digit code and click on the `Enable` button to confirm the 2FA activation.

5. Store **Backup Codes** you will see on the next page somewhere safe - it can be used to disable the 2FA in the future.

2FA for IVPN apps is only available for accounts that were created after November 2020 (account ID format: i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX). If you wish to use 2FA for apps and have an IVPN subscription created before this date (account ID format: ivpnXXXXXXXX), contact our customer service to help you make the switch.
