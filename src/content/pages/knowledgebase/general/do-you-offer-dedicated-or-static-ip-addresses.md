# Do you offer dedicated or static IP addresses?

No, we do not offer dedicated or static IP addresses for privacy reasons. We use shared IPs to ensure sufficient interface crowding on the servers. Crowding is used to increase the total number of users sharing the same IP,  which combined with encryption makes it harder for a 3rd party to attribute an outgoing connection to an incoming one thereby significantly increasing your privacy.
