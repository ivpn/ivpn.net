# What is the IP address of your DNS servers?

The IVPN DNS servers clients use when connected to our VPN servers are not publicly accessible from the Internet. They are internal and can be used only when connected to an IVPN server. To work out the address of the closest DNS server, simply look at the IP assigned to you when you connect. The DNS servers are in the format **10.x.y.1**. For example, if the VPN address you receive is **10.16.4.66** then the DNS will be on **10.16.4.1**. The following DNS is used when you connect to a WireGuard server - **172.16.0.1**

When you connect using our [native apps](/apps/), IVPN DNS is automatically applied to your system. If you connect using a different VPN client or a platform, like routers, you can specify one of the following DNS IP addresses:

* **10.0.254.1** = regular DNS with no blocking (OpenVPN only) (use **10.0.254.101** for Multi-hop connections).
* **10.0.254.2** = standard AntiTracker to block advertising and malware domains (OpenVPN + WireGuard).
* **10.0.254.3** = Hardcore Mode AntiTracker to also block Google and Facebook domains (OpenVPN + WireGuard).

We also provide a public, validating, non-logging, recursive DNS server available at **`198.245.51.147`**.  No IVPN connection -- or account -- required.
