#### CLI

IVPN CLI app stores logs in the following file - `/opt/ivpn/log/IVPN_Agent.log*`. Attach the file(s) to your e-mail message to our support department or copy/paste the file contents into your support request.

#### Manual

1.  If you are using a different VPN client, use 'grep' to filter the OpenVPN logs from the system log e.g.
    ```
    sudo grep VPN /var/log/syslog
    ```

2.  If the step above outputs what appears to be the VPN logs then run the command below to create a log file in your home directory
    ```
    sudo grep VPN /var/log/syslog > ~/ivpn.log
    ```

3.  If you cannot see OpenVPN log entries in syslog, add the following line to the .ovpn file to enable file logging.
    ```
    log /var/log/openvpn
    ```

4.  If you are using NetworkManager, the following command will capture more details and create a file in your home directory:
    ```
    egrep -i "vpn|NetworkManager|nm-openvpn|nm-dispatcher" /var/log/syslog > ~/ivpn.log
    ```
