# I forgot my IVPN Account ID. What should I do?

The IVPN Account ID looks with `i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` or `ivpnXXXXXXXX`.

To locate the IVPN Account ID in the original, `ivpnXXXXXXXX` format, log into the [Client Area](/account/) with your email address and your current password.

Your IVPN Account ID can also be found in the **Settings > Account** area in the IVPN App for all platforms.  Click or tap the **Account** icon (minimalist head-with-shoulders button on the app's main screen) to access the Account screen.

We can also try and look up your IVPN Account ID if you send us an email (support@ivpn.net) with the information of your last purchase.  Use [PGP encryption](/knowledgebase/general/how-do-i-send-a-secure-pgp-encrypted-email-to-ivpn/) for the message if you prefer.

For card payments on made on our website, provide:
- **first 6 digits** of the card 
- **last 4 digits** of the card 
- **expiry date** of the card 

For PayPal, Bitcoin, or Monero payments, provide the **transaction ID**.

For Android payments, provide the **Google Invoice ID** (starts with [GPA](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160235)).

If there was a successful payment to Apple, please provide us with the [invoice from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204088).  The personal details, like mailing address and email address, are not required, though we do need to see the Invoice ID and Document Number from Apple.

For voucher payments, provide the **voucher code**.
