# I paid with PayPal but my account is still pending. Why?

Accounts are activated automatically after payment has been received from the payment processor. This requires that PayPal sends a message to our servers indicating that the payment was successful. In very rare circumstances this message between servers can fail. However it's more likely that you have sent an [e-check payment](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/helphub/article/?solutionId=FAQ1082) (a payment made from your bank account) which won't clear for a few days (unlike a credit/debit card which is instant). If this is the case please be patient until PayPal processes the payment.
