# Voucher cards FAQ

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--info">
Voucher payment method is only available for accounts that were created after November 2020 (account ID format: i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX). If you wish to use vouchers and have an IVPN account created before this date (account ID format: ivpnXXXXXXXX), contact our customer service to help you make the switch or generate a new account.

1. ### Where can I purchase IVPN voucher?
    Voucher cards are currently available on [Amazon US](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BL8FWDRL). We plan to introduce it to other countries in the future.

2. ### How do I redeem the voucher?
    One voucher card can be redeemed for either 2 years of IVPN Standard or 1 year of IVPN Pro. It can be used for activating a newly generated account as well as extending the duration of an existing one.

    #### New accounts:
    - Select the preferred plan and generate your IVPN account in [here](/pricing/)
    - Click on the `Add more time` - "Have a voucher code? `Redeem it here`" link
    - Enter the voucher code and press `Add Time`

    #### Existing accounts:
    - Log into your [Client Area](/account/login#id)
    - Click on the `Add more time` - "Have a voucher code? `Redeem it here`" link
    - Enter the voucher code and press `Add Time`

3. ### The voucher redeem page says the code is invalid or has already been used.
    Reach out to our [support team](/contactus/) including the voucher code in your message and we will look into this.

4. ### I have lost my account ID. Can you help me recover it?
    Send us a [message](/contactus/) including your voucher code and we will look up your account ID.

    <div markdown="1" class="notice notice--warning">
    Please note: voucher codes are stored in our system only for 30 days after use. Account recovery is not possible after this period.
    </div>

5. ### Can I get a refund for my voucher purchase?

    Voucher purchases are non-refundable.

6. ### There are shipping issues with my order / I received a damaged card

    Unfortunately, we are unable to help with these types of issues. For assistance, please contact the vendor you have purchased the voucher from.
