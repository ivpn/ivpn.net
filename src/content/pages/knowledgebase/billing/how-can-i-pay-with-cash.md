# How can I pay with cash?

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--info">
Due to the manual processing required we accept cash payments only for 1, 2, or 3 years. Cash payments are not refundable.
</div>

1. [Sign up](/pricing/) for a new account. 

2. On the checkout page, select 1 year or longer and click on the `Cash` button.

3. After you click the `Cash` button you will be redirected to a page with instructions on how and where to send the cash.

If you would like to add more time to an existing account, login to the [Client Area](/account/login/), click on the `Billing Settings` -> `Extend your account`, select 1 year or longer and click on the `Cash` button to checkout.
