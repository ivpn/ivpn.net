# What happens if laws change forcing IVPN to compromise their customers privacy?

IVPN is committed to keeping its customers informed of any serious legislative threats to our service. If the laws in our jurisdiction change in way that prevents us from upholding our privacy policy we will always inform our customers before those laws are enacted. We will also allow customers to cancel their subscription and will refund any fees that cover the remainder of their subscription period.
