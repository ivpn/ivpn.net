# What information is collected and stored about all visitors to your website?

IVPN uses [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly called Piwik) to analyze and aggregate information about our website visitors. When your web browser loads a page on our site, a small snippet of javascript code is executed within your browser which submits information about the device from which you are connecting such as your browser user-agent, language, screen resolution, referring website, a redacted IP address (167.114.18.34 becomes 167.114.0.0), etc. to a private server operated by IVPN. None of this information is personally identifying and is never shared with 3rd parties.
